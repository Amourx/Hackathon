Dear Matthew,

I am writing to you to tell you how much you truly mean to me. This last year was one of the best years of my life and it's all because of you. I love you with every beating piece of my heart. Every train of thought turns to you. You are the most wonderful, smart, talented, handsome man I have ever met and I thank God every day that you're mine. I love you more than I could ever explain, more than I even understand. I hope that we last forever. I hope you are the man I marry. I love you, you are my baby.

Love always,

Appolonia Dawn
